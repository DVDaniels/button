            <h3>Who is David Daniels?</h3>
            <p>David Daniels is a Web Developer who is also an avid social media user. David is sometimes known as an ‚ÄúInternet Digger‚Äù, someone who knows how to find information on the web that is not censored.
            </p>
            <p>David‚Äôs ability to find and spread information that goes against the grain of mainstream media gets him into quite a bit
            or trouble online. David has been a victim of Facebooks fact checkers and has lost access to his Facebook account on
            numerous occasions. The same goes for his twitter and YouTube accounts.</p>
            <p>In response to the rampant censorship by the big tech giants, David developed the Tiny Website. The homepage is
            dedicated to helping his followers find him on the social media platforms he is currently using.
